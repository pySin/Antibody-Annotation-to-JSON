# Antibody-Annotation-to-JSON
This project is a Python-based utility that converts Antibody Annotation Data, designed in a specific format (created by Professor Andrew Martin), into structured JSON files. It facilitates the organization and transformation of raw data into a machine-readable structure for further analysis and integration into workflows.

Features:
- Process single files or entire directories of annotation data.
- Automatically organize and extract key information, including:
- Request IDs
- Antigen Details (Name and Gene)
- Notes
- Chains (e.g., Heavy and Light chains with sequences)

Save output in clean, hierarchical JSON files.
